# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview

Pewlett Hackward is a large company that has been around for long time. As many of their employees getting close to retirement, the company would like to plan ahead, analyzing their workforce and determining the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. To have a better insigh into the project, we will use SQL to retrieve data from workforce information  to get the Number of Retiring Employees by Title and Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program. At the end of our analysis,  we will provide a report on our findings to help Pewlett Hackward's managers making better decisions.
